    <h1>In Race To Vaccinate New York State, Bronx Falls Behind</h1>
    <figcaption>by Brandon Futernick</figcaption>

    <p>As the race to vaccinate as many citizens as possible against the coronavirus rolls on, addressing uneven rates of vaccination is a key factor in establishing the ultimate goal of herd immunity. In New York, approximately 43% of the state’s
      population has received a full series of their vaccines to date (A full series is defined as 2 doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine or 1 dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine). That number is encouraging, as it is above the <a
        href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations">national average</a>
      of 38%, but at a closer look, rates across the state are uneven.<br><br>

      When comparing data provided by the <a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/covid-19-vaccine-tracker">New York State Vaccine Tracker</a> to 2019 Census population numbers, the Bronx has consistently shown the lowest rate of full
      vaccinations across the state. As of May 19th, their rate of residents that have
      received a full vaccine series was just 31.6%. Though the most recent data shows that they’ve pulled slightly ahead of Allegany County, who currently has a 30% fully vaccination rate, this is the first time in New York’s rollout thus far where
      Bronx was not dead last.<br><br>

      But why is the Bronx falling behind the rest of the state? The answer has to do with a combination of lack of access and general vaccine hesitancy on the behalf of residents. From a demographic standpoint, <a
        href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/bronxcountybronxboroughnewyork">U.S. Census</a> data shows that the
      dominant demographic in the Bronx is Hispanic or Latino, who account for 56% of the population. 44% of the population is Black.<br><br>

      A recent study from the <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/latest-data-on-covid-19-vaccinations-race-ethnicity/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, or KFF, an organization that studies issues in national health across the
      U.S., noted that there have been consistent disparities in vaccination rates in America on the basis of ethnicity. In
      New York, they found that rates of vaccination for Black people were 17 percentage points behind that of White people, and the rates for people with Hispanic backgrounds were similarly 11 percentage points behind that of White people.
      <br><br>
      A study published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8009077/">U.S. National Library of Medicine</a> by Dr. Cato T. Laurencin notes that vaccine hesitancy is particularly high among Black communities like those in the
      Bronx. “Black people cite our nation’s history of racism in medical
      research and in medical care as key reasons for their hesitancy,” Laurencin writes, calling the distrust “totally justified.” Exacerbating the issue, he explains, is the fact that “Black men are increasingly underrepresented in the medical
      profession,” which only adds to the distrust. “The medical community must do more to improve care and create trust in the Black community,” he concluded.
      <br><br>
      Reporting by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/nyregion/vaccine-hesitancy-outreach.html">New York Times</a> on the ground in the Bronx showed that Dr. Laurencin’s theories rang true. A number of residents interviewed by the Times
      expressed skepticism about the vaccine. In one instance, a resident cited news that
      Moderna was preparing booster shots as a sign that the vaccine was not as effective as advertised. In another, a young girl insisted to a community organizer that “they’re putting something in the vaccine to kill people.” Conspiracy theories
      like this one can spread like wildfire over social media and contribute to the baseline hesitancy already felt by Black people in communities like the Bronx.
